# Pedelec

#This repository is related to the the pedelec. An ebike which uses VESC controller is used to control the BLDC motors. A PAS sesnor is used to detect the direction of pedalling and using this information, we send power to the motor. Currently, I am testing with the Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Mode of communication is UART. This repository is currently being worked on.
